# Oh My Bash!
Fresh transformation of Bash from a useless playground to a full-featured shell.

## Install
Run this command:

```bash
exec bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmybashrc/ohmybash/main/install.sh)"
```

To update, change "install.sh" to "update.sh" at the end of the command, or run `omb update`.

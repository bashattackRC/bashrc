# Bash Attack

Bash Attack is a collection of several files to enhance your Bash experience.

## Install
Run this command:

```bash
exec bash -c "$(curl -fsSL -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bashattackRC/bashrc/main/install.sh)"
```

To update, change "install.sh" to "update.sh" at the end of the command, or run `ba update`.

If your terminal suddenly closes or you suddenly get logged out, you need to install curl first.

The completions plugin allows you to use completions related
to the `ba` command, and also allows you to place your own
completion scripts in ~/.omb/completions.

Custom Completions
  Completions are prefixed with `omb-` without quotes and with
  the dash. Here`s a base:
  _baz()
  {
      local cur=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}
      COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W "fooOption barOption" -- $cur) )
  }
  complete -F _baz baz

  This will allow completing `baz` with the options `fooOption`
  and `barOption`.

These are some plugins we highly prefer:

1. copypasta
   This lets you paste scripts from the internet that leave the dollar
   sign behind each line, without having to remove them. Just type
   copypasta, paste your script, and save. Then watch the magic.
2. git
   Enabled by default, this is a plugin that allows you to see your
   working Git branches in your prompt (at least for most themes).
   It also provides a few handy aliases.
3. gh-shell
   This is for the gh-shell extension for GitHub CLI - it replaces the
   bash_history file with a GitHub gist. We only recommend using this
   if you don't plan to enter commands with personal info, however.

This help page is about developing themes. In the context of Oh my Bash, themes are custom
scripts to create prompts that make Bash look more fancy than an old unused AK-47.

REQUIREMENTS
* Install the latest Oh My Bash version. You shouldn't need to do this as you are likely
  reading this page using the `omb help` command.
* Install git and authenticate your GitHub account to push the changes to users.
* Bash should be available on your system. Systems with GNU userlands should offer bash by default.
  macOS also provides bash, but will be forever stuck on bash 3 due to GPL 3.0 relicensing.
* Use bash as your default shell. If you don't want to, run the following command: 
           exec bash

MULTILINE PROMPTS
  Bash will go mad if you add multiple lines to the PS1 variable. There is a workaround for this.
  Instead of adding multiple lines to PS1, add a new command to PROMPT_COMMANDS and use it to echo any lines
  before the part where input is took:
           PROMPT_COMMANDS+=("echo mytheme")

  This may cause glitches after changing the theme, as the lines that don't take input will stay there.
  Enabling another multiline theme will cause a group of lines coming from other themes.
  A fix will be released soon ;)

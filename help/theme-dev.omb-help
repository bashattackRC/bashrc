This help page is about developing themes. In the context of @@PROJECTNAME@@, themes are custom
scripts to create prompts that make Bash look more fancy than an old unused AK-47.

Requirements
* Install the latest @@PROJECTNAME@@ version. You shouldn't need to do this as you are likely
  reading this page using the `ba help` command.
* Install git and authenticate your GitHub account to push the changes to users.
* Bash should be available on your system. Systems with GNU userlands should offer bash by default.
  macOS also provides bash, but will be forever stuck on bash 3 due to GPL 3.0 relicensing.
* Use bash as your default shell. If you don't want to, run the following command: 
           exec bash

Multiline
  Bash will go mad if you add multiple lines to the PS1 variable. There is a workaround for this.
  Instead of adding multiple lines to PS1, add a new command to PROMPT_COMMANDS and use it to echo any lines
  before the part where input is took:
           PROMPT_COMMANDS+=("echo mytheme")

  This may cause glitches after changing the theme, as the lines that don't take input will stay there.
  Enabling another multiline theme will cause a group of lines coming from other themes.
  A fix will be released soon ;)

Base
  Themes go in the themes folder under the prefix omb-.
  Bash uses the value "$PS1" (NOT Playstation) to store the prompt. PS1 stands for Prompt String 1.

Rules for Submission:
  * DON'T add specific integrations to themes, other than theme helpers needed to provide info to
    the theme. Integrations should be in plugins.
  * Themes should not leak colors out of the prompt. Always reset the color at the end.
  * Don't use "echo", "printf", or others in themes, except in the case of the multiline workaround
    mentioned in this document.
